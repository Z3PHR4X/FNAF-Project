# FNAF Project
 
Spare time project to recreate the classic Five Night's at Freddy's experience in Unity.

Currently, I'm rewriting my 4 year old code, to turn the spaghetti mess that it is, into a more modular reusable format.
Don't expect this to be done anytime soon. 

Also, only providing the scripts right now, as there's only placeholder assets right now..
