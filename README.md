# FNAF Project
<i>Developed by: Darryl Reekers (Zephrax)</i>
<h4>This project is currently supported for Unity version 2021.3.30f1 (LTS)</h3>

Spare time project to recreate the classic Five Night's at Freddy's experience in Unity.
Currently, I'm rewriting my 4 year old code, to turn it into a more modular reusable format.
My first goal is to create a faithful recreation of the original FNAF gameplay, after which I'll rework and add new mechanics to add my own flair and ideas to create something original.
I cannot give an estimate when this project will be completed, this is all done in my spare time whenever I feel like working on it.

<h4>Status: </h4>

> **âš  IMPORTANT: Things will break in the coming updates**   
> Gameplay code is currently being rewritten, this may break certain functionality or cause unwanted side effects.
