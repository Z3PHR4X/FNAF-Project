# FNAF Project
<i>Developed by: Darryl Reekers (Zephrax)</i>
<h4>This project is currently supported for Unity version 2021.3.30f1 (LTS)</h3>

Spare time project to recreate the classic Five Night's at Freddy's experience in Unity.
Currently, I'm rewriting my 4 year-ish old code, to turn it into a more modular reusable format. As of now it's open-source, if you end up using any of my code please give proper credit.
Depending on the direction this project will take, I might leave this as a framework for others to use as inspiration or to build their own projects from as a starting point.

My first goal is to create a faithful recreation of the original FNAF gameplay, after which I'll rework and add new mechanics to add my own flair and ideas to create something original.
The first part is already progressing well, there is still mainly work to be done on AI interaction with the player. After which I'll polish and refactor code.
I cannot give an estimate when this project will be completed, this is all done in my spare time whenever I feel like working on it.

<h4>Status: </h4>

> **âš  IMPORTANT: Things will break in the coming updates**   
> Gameplay code is currently being rewritten, this may break certain functionality or cause unwanted side effects.   
> Testing is being performed to minimize these effects, but older code might still persist and be incompatible with reworked systems.
